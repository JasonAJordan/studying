## Apply what you know

# 1.1 Write a program that produces the following output:
# Hello Fred
# Hello Ted
# Hello Ed

# names = ['Fred', 'Ted', 'Ed']
# for name in names:
#   print('Hello', name)

# 1.2. Write a program that produces the following output:
# ham on rye
# ham on whole wheat
# ham on a roll
# pastrami on rye
# pastrami on whole wheat
# pastrami on a roll
# roast beef on rye
# roast beef on whole wheat
# roast beef on a roll
# chicken on rye
# chicken on whole

# meats = ['ham', 'pastrami', 'roast beef', 'chicken']
# breads = ['rye', 'whole wheat', 'role']
# for m in meats:
#   for b in breads:
#     print(m, 'on', b)

# 1.3 Write a program that checks the word ‘pineapple’ and tells us what vowels it contains.
# vowels = 'aeiou'
# for v in vowels:
#   if v in 'pineapple':
#       print('found', v)

# The word ‘substantiate’ contains the word ‘ant’.  Write a program that reports which
# of the following words is contained in ‘substantiate’: ‘ate’, ‘state’, ‘a’, ‘substantiate’,
# ‘it’, ‘tan’.  The output should look like this:

# ate is a substring of substantiate
# a is a substring of substantiate
# substantiate is a substring of substantiate
# tan is a substring of substantiate

# letters = ['substantiate', 'ate', 'state', 'a', 'substantiate', 'it', 'tan']
# for l in letters:
#   if l in 'substantiate':
#       print(l, 'is a substring of substantiate' )

# 4 Write a program that prints the name Fred 100 times, one time per line.  Your
# program should be reasonably short and should not include a list containing more
# than ten items or a string containing more than ten characters.

# for lp in range(100):
#   print('Fred')

#Write a program that counts down from 10 to 1.  The output should look like this:

# for num in range(10):
#   n = 10-num
#   print(n)

# 6.Write a program that tells us which vowels are used in each of the following words:
# ‘apple’, ‘banana’, ‘peach’, ‘grapefruit’.  The output should look like this:

# fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'peach', 'grapefruit']
# vowels = 'aeiou'
# for f in fruits:
#   print ('Vowels in', f)
#   for v in vowels:
#     if v in f:
#         print( v )
