// Define two classes: a Folder and a File
// the Folder should have a name (string), and a vector of Files (vector<File>)
// the File should have a name (string), the content in the folder (string), and a Folder pointer (Folder*) to indicate which folder the File is in. 
// The content should be initialized to the empty string, and the Folder pointer should be initialized with nullptr.
